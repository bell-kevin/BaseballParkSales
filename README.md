# BaseballParkSales
BaseballParkSales. In this project, you will simulate sales by the vendors in the stands at a baseball park. They walk around selling hot dogs, bottles of soda, team-logo ball caps, and balloons, in this simulation. These items are 2 categories of inventory -- food and souvenirs. Food items have a 10% tax. Souvenir items have a 5% tax. Also, it is possible to get volume discounts on souvenir items. There are 2 discounts available -- if you buy more than 15 items, the discount rate is 15%; if you buy more than 8 items, the discount rate is 5%. Notice these discounts are to the sale of each item, before any sales tax is applied. When the sale qualifies for a discount, print a message with the discount rate
